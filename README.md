✅ Post 1: React Random Color Generator (HEX & RGB)
🎨 Just built a fun React project: Random Color Generator!

In this mini project, I explored the use of React hooks like useState and useEffect to dynamically generate and apply random background colors in both HEX and RGB formats. 🔄

🔧 Features:

HEX & RGB color modes

Dynamic background color changes

Smooth CSS transitions

One-click color generation

Clean UI with responsive buttons

🧠 Tech Stack:

React.js

JavaScript

Inline CSS styling

useEffect, useState

🚀 This was a great exercise to reinforce conditional rendering, state management, and utility function use in React.
